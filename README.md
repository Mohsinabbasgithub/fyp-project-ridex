# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# fyp-project-ridex
This project is vehicles rental system like inDrive.
RIDEX implements emerging technology to deliver simplified car rental processes for 
its users through its C-to-C vehicle rental system. Users discover platform-based car 
owners and renters to maintain simple and low-cost rental operations through this 
platform. RIDEX users get to search for rental cars through an effortless search system 
that enables them to securely book cars and finalize payments through an easy-to-use 
payment system. Places that desire budget-friendly comfortable car rentals face 
considerable difficulties due to insufficient rental options available within their 
geographical area. The traditional rental agreements generate unclear conditions which 
fail to build stable trust between parties. 
RIDEX resolves these problems by providing transparency in its cost structure while 
ensuring payment security through AI reviews to establish trust between the parties. 
RIDEX offers a marketplace through which owners can list cars alongside driver 
registration features plus a system where drivers may develop their RIDEX-based 
business. RIDEX establishes trustworthy rentals through neatly designed procedures as 
well as secure payment processing technology to create user-friendly rental events for 
users and vehicle owners.
