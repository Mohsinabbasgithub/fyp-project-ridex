This project is vehicles rental system like inDrive.
RIDEX implements emerging technology to deliver simplified car rental processes for 
its users through its C-to-C vehicle rental system. Users discover platform-based car 
owners and renters to maintain simple and low-cost rental operations through this 
platform. RIDEX users get to search for rental cars through an effortless search system 
that enables them to securely book cars and finalize payments through an easy-to-use 
payment system. Places that desire budget-friendly comfortable car rentals face 
considerable difficulties due to insufficient rental options available within their 
geographical area. The traditional rental agreements generate unclear conditions which 
fail to build stable trust between parties. 
RIDEX resolves these problems by providing transparency in its cost structure while 
ensuring payment security through AI reviews to establish trust between the parties. 
RIDEX offers a marketplace through which owners can list cars alongside driver 
registration features plus a system where drivers may develop their RIDEX-based 
business. RIDEX establishes trustworthy rentals through neatly designed procedures as 
well as secure payment processing technology to create user-friendly rental events for 
users and vehicle owners.
